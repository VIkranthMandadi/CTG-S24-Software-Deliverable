For accessing the data for everg stock in the ticker.txt file there is a .csv file in the data folder.
If you navigate to the data folder and click ony .csv file the preceding word beifre .csv will indicated the ticker that is contained in that .csv file. 

For interpreting the data the field in the top row indicates what the value of the colum corresponds too. For example,
the first column has a field labeled "data" in the first row, so that means that column is labeling all the dates for this .csv file. This is the same all the way across. These columns are also color coded. 

As this was my first time accessing the yahoo finance API that was a little bit of a challenge, but the API was very
simple to use, therefore a simple google search alongside the resources provided was sufficient to get past this challenge. Not any major challenges just some googling and using the provided resources to figure out what can be done with the API and how to fetch the data.
